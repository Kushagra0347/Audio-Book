# Audio-Book

This is my first python project. It is an Audio book made up of two programs, namely:-
1. PDFtoMP3
2. MP3 Player

PDFtoMP3 converts the PDF in MP3 format and then when the user runs the MP3 player Program and clicks on that PDF. He can listen to that PDF

The problem is I have to use two programs to do this thing.

If anyone could merge these two programs into a one single program, it would be of great help
